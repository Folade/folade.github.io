			<h1>fola.de</h1>

			<p>Being able to shepherd a brand story from conception and grow it into a complete narrative and connecting audiences along the way is a skill set that I've tailored not only through agenting proposals into books for publishers, but also in a business development role where I was responsible for creating and marketing sponsor driven events for clients such as Adobe, MediaRadar and Aurasma.</p>
			
			<p>I’ve worked extensively with content strategy in the publishing industry to generate brand awareness and engagement and build communities.</p> 

			<p>I love typography, lettering and the written word. I'm a marketer who knows how to code. I'm a marketing alumnus of the Startup Institute.</p>

			<p>My name is pronounced like holiday only with an F!</p>
